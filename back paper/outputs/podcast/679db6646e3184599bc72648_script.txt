**Title:** Integrating Generative AI for Enhanced Automation in System Design Processes

**Introduction**

Generative AI (Gen AI) is revolutionizing system engineering, particularly in system design. By utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs), system engineers can automate complex design tasks, generate innovative solutions, and improve efficiency. However, evaluating the accuracy and reliability of Gen AI-generated system design outputs remains a challenge.

**Gen AI in System Design**

Gen AI offers numerous benefits in system design:

* Automation of design tasks
* Generation of innovative solutions
* Analysis of vast data and extraction of patterns

**System Design Evaluation**

Evaluating system design outputs generated by LLMs is crucial to ensure accuracy, reliability, and compliance. Traditional methods have limitations, such as being resource-intensive and unable to capture real-world complexities. Gen AI offers more efficient and flexible evaluation methods.

**Existing Evaluation Methods and Limitations**

Existing methods for evaluating LLM-generated content struggle to assess system design-specific content due to its specialized terminology and complex structures. They also lack metrics to evaluate factors like innovation and practical applicability.

**SE Assistant for System Design Generation and Evaluation**

We propose the SE Assistant, a tool that leverages Gen AI to generate and evaluate system design documents (DesDocs). It combines GPT-4 with a Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation (M-RAG) pipeline to provide context-specific information.

**Generation Process**

1. System requirements and constraints are input into the SE Assistant.
2. The M-RAG pipeline retrieves relevant content from a vector database.
3. GPT-4 uses the retrieved content to generate a comprehensive DesDoc.

**Evaluation Process**

1. The DesDoc is evaluated against predefined criteria using multiple LLMs.
2. The evaluation scores are combined with an engineer's assessment to provide a comprehensive evaluation.
3. The evaluations are used to improve the quality of future DesDocs.

**Implementation and Results**

The SE Assistant has been implemented and tested on various system design tasks. The results demonstrate that it outperforms other methods in terms of system requirements met, evaluation scores, and combined scores.

**Conclusion**

Gen AI has the potential to enhance automation and improve the efficiency and accuracy of system design processes. By leveraging Gen AI for system design generation and evaluation, system engineers can reduce costs, accelerate design timelines, and optimize system performance. Future work will focus on refining the SE Assistant and incorporating dynamic human feedback mechanisms.
