**Key Points: Integrating Generative AI for Enhanced Automation in System Design Processes**

**Introduction:**
* Generative AI (Gen AI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) offer advancements in system design.
* This research focuses on how Gen AI can enhance the efficiency and accuracy of system design documentation.

**Gen AI in System Engineering:**
* LLMs enable automation, innovative solutions, and insights in system design.
* They accelerate design tasks and enhance system quality.
* Evaluating LLM-generated design content is crucial for accuracy, reliability, and safety.

**System Design Generation and Evaluation Methods:**
* **SE Assistant:** LLM-based tool for generating System Design Documents (DesDocs) using Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation (M-RAG).
* **Generation:**
    * Uses M-RAG pipeline to provide context-specific system design knowledge.
    * Employs GPT-4 for content generation based on input system requirements.
* **Evaluation:**
    * Uses LLMs and engineers to evaluate DesDoc against criteria like technical accuracy, compliance, and innovation.
    * LLMs provide data-driven evaluations, while engineers provide human insights.

**Implementation Flow:**
* Defines evaluation criteria for DesDoc quality.
* Generation flow creates a DesDoc using M-RAG.
* Evaluation flow evaluates DesDoc using LLMs and engineers.
* Combined score is used for improvement.

**Discussion:**
* Results show that M-RAG significantly improves the quality of DesDocs compared to baselines.
* The SE Assistant tool enhances efficiency and accuracy in system design.

**Conclusion:**
* Gen AI, integrated through the SE Assistant, improves system design documentation in complex systems.
* Future work will focus on incorporating dynamic feedback mechanisms.
